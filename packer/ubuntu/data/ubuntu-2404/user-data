  updates: all

  # late-commands are run at the very end of the *installer*, before the first
  # reboot. However users are actually created by cloud-init after the first
  # reboot. So these commands can't affect anything that requires a user to
  # actually exist.
  late-commands:
    # Add xen-guest-agent - this is impossible (!) on Ubuntu 24.04 using
    # the normal apt/packages autoinstall configuration, because (a) the
    # xen-guest-agent apt repository does not use the "components" field
    # (odd, but legal); (b) curtin's apt-config process hard requires
    # deb822 .sources to have a "Components:" key, and (c) even if we
    # try to configure it with a .list entry rather than .source entry
    # under "apt:", on Ubuntu 24 curtin force-converts "deb" lines to
    # deb822 format. I wasted days on this. Have to just do it the
    # old-fashioned way here.
    - 'echo "deb [trusted=yes] https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/xen-project%252Fxen-guest-agent/packages/generic/deb-amd64/ release/" > /target/etc/apt/sources.list.d/xen.list'
    - curtin in-target --target /target -- apt-get update
    - curtin in-target --target /target -- apt-get install -y xen-guest-agent

    # If you want to do anything custom with files from "cd_files",
    # uncomment these lines
    #- mount /dev/sr1 /mnt
    #- cp /mnt/my-cool.conf /target/etc/path/cool.conf
    #- umount /mnt

  # User-data is passed to the "real" cloud-init, which runs after the first
  # reboot after the installer has finished. So you can run commands which
  # modify users here, such as added 'initialuser' to a new group.
  # We need the initial user to be able to call cloud-init password-less
  # for packer to wait on the first boot.
  user-data:
    users:
      - name: initialuser
        sudo:
          - 'ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/cloud-init status --wait'
          - 'ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/cloud-init clean --logs --machine-id'
